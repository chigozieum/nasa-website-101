"The best time to prepare was yesterday. The next best time is now." — Captain Treasure Abundance

Disasters don’t send invites. Whether it's flooding, fire, or financial collapse, most people are simply not prepared. And when you’re unprepared, you panic. Panic leads to loss—not just of property, but sometimes of life.

At NASA Frigate Foundation, under the fearless Captainship of Treasure Abundance, we believe that the greatest gift you can give a community is readiness. Not just emergency aid after disaster strikes, but the tools, training, and systems that prevent tragedies from happening in the first place.

🛑 The Shocking Truth: Most Families Are One Crisis Away from Collapse
Here’s what we’ve observed across coastal and inland communities alike:

87% of families don’t have an emergency plan.

65% have less than 3 days’ worth of food and water.

92% don’t know their local shelter location.

72% of youths have never been trained in first aid.

This is not just alarming—it’s deadly.

That’s why Captain Treasure Abundance launched the Frigate Emergency Readiness Initiative (FERI) — a people-centered response program aimed at training, equipping, and empowering families before disaster strikes.

🧭 What You Need to Do Right Now
Here’s a quick but vital 5-step action plan you can start immediately—whether you're a parent, student, or elder.

1. 📦 Build a 72-Hour Emergency Kit
Your home should have:

3 days of non-perishable food (canned, dry)

3 gallons of water per person

Flashlights + extra batteries

Basic first-aid supplies

Copies of ID documents

Small cash reserve

NASA Frigate Foundation distributes free starter kits in vulnerable areas—no registration needed.

2. 🗺 Know Your Escape Routes
Map at least two ways out of your home and neighborhood.

Know where local shelters and hospitals are.

Have a contact outside your town to coordinate with.

Under Captain Treasure Abundance, our volunteers are mapping and distributing custom escape route plans tailored to high-risk communities.

3. 📱 Make a Family Communication Plan
Agree on a meeting place.

Teach kids how to use emergency numbers.

Save an "ICE" (In Case of Emergency) contact on everyone’s phone.

The Frigate Team will soon release a free laminated Family Emergency Plan card for households to pin on their walls.

4. 🧠 Train for the Worst, Hope for the Best
Learn CPR and basic first aid.

Know how to shut off your gas, water, and electricity.

Practice mock drills once a month.

Frigate’s “Train Your Block” program, led by veterans and medics, will offer free workshops on survival skills starting this August.

5. 🔄 Stay Informed
Sign up for SMS and email alerts from your local authorities.

Follow verified social media channels for updates.

NASA Frigate Foundation is working to launch the “Frigate Alert Line”, a community-run SMS-based update system for emergencies—even in low-internet zones.

⚓ How NASA Frigate Foundation Is Making a Difference
Captain Treasure Abundance has made community readiness one of the cornerstones of our 2025–2026 strategy. Here’s what’s underway:

✅ 1. The Frigate Emergency Readiness Initiative (FERI)
Prepping 5,000 emergency kits for low-income households.

Deploying mobile teams to train 20,000 people by year-end.

Partnering with local schools to include disaster preparedness in the curriculum.

✅ 2. Safe Zones Installation
We’re converting abandoned buildings into climate-resilient safe shelters, each stocked with:

Solar energy

Clean water

Food for 7 days

Emergency bedding

✅ 3. Youth Emergency Corps
Under the direction of Treasure Abundance, we’re training 500 young leaders in disaster response, communications, and logistics. These “Cadets of the Frigate” will be the first line of organized civilian response during crises.

🔥 Real Stories from the Frontlines
Bayelsa, Nigeria – April 2025

A flash flood wiped out several riverfront homes. Amid the chaos, Frigate volunteers—mostly teenagers—set up a rapid-response camp using gear they’d trained with just a month earlier.

14 people were rescued by boats organized by our Youth Corps.

3 medical emergencies were stabilized before ambulances arrived.

1 mother safely delivered a baby at our makeshift shelter.

That’s not luck—that’s preparation in motion.
